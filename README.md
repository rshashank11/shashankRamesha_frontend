# Social Care Wales Registration Page

### Approach & Tech Choices
1. I approached it from top to bottom. Making sure each of the component was complete before moving on to the next.
2. I went with pure HTML5 and CSS3, as the main objective was to replicate a static page with no event handling or validation.
3. Flexbox was my main positioning tool mostly due to its ease to use and responsiveness.
4. I used pixel-based absolute positioning for the background vectors to match the specific coordinates found in the Figma properties.
5. I used the "checkbox hack" for the hamburger menu. It uses a hidden checkbox to toggle the menu open and closed and doesn't require scripting.

### Assumptions
1. Fonts: Used standard web-safe sans-serif fallbacks (Arial/Helvetica) while following the 300 and 600 weights specified in the Figma properties.
2. Breakpoints: A 1200px breakpoint was chosen to switch to mobile view to prevent the text especially in the primary navigation bar from feeling too compressed on smaller desktop screens.
